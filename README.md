# Kollier Martin: Full-Stack Developer <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/be/Circle-icons-stack.svg/2048px-Circle-icons-stack.svg.png" width="35" height="35">

## About Me

```java
class Greeting {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    sayHello();
  }

  private static void sayHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello world, my name is Kollier Martin.");
  }
}
```

Apparently I have two last names :laughing:. Kollier is pronounced (Call-Yer) and the pronunciation with Martin is a
given. I am a Full-Stack developer with around 2 years of experience. I mostly handle project logic pertaining to
anything Java related, but I also have a bit of experience in front-end development with Angular/React. The reason I am
in this industry is that I love to code. In my spare time, I will practice new languages, work on my knowledge of
fundamentals, and take swings at problems that involve complex algorithms (that may never be used in normal
environments). My hobbies are: traveling, gaming, and reading.

This repo contains some practice problem solutions, mini projects used over the years that helped me understand
principles, and a few coding challenges. I plan to reiterate challenges that I completed in Java, in the form of the new
languages that I learn over time. Thanks for stopping by and enjoy your day!

### • Project Experience •

*[March 2022 - March 2023]*     
**Commercial Experience Layer (AMEX)**    
&nbsp; • Developed reactive APIs, from the ground up, involving B2B operations for client consumption. These APIs were
used to store, process, and manipulate client data.   
&nbsp; • Incorporated GitHub as project version control    
&nbsp; • Utilized JIRA for sprint planning and story updates   
&nbsp; • Utilized Splunk for application analysis. This involved logging, alerts, reports, and API performance (response
times and log efficiency)   
&nbsp; • Implemented MSA, with gradle and maven for artifact building.   
&nbsp; • For CICD, deployments were handled using Jenkins pipelines and monitored through ‘RedHat eCP’
