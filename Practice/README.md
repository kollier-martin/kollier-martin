# Practice <img src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/421885/archery-focus-goal.svg" width="35" height="35">

This repo contains a few self practice scenarios between all languages I have learned. Full projects are not included!
This is to show that I have a basic understanding of language specific functionality and how to implement proof of
concepts.

Currently, I am adding a few more Java CodingChallenges and random Java practice as the versions are updated. In order,
I want to work on these languages/platforms: Scala, J2EE, and C++.

## • Java •

[Basics](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/Basics): contains practice with the new additions to Java 8 and a
README.md explaining the classes <br><br>
[CodingChallenges](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/CodingChallenges): This package contains coding challenges
from LeetCode, along with a README.md explaining the problems. <br><br>
[ColonialDB](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/ColonialDB): This package contains DBMS solutions to the
Colonial database. I have to create the script to populate tables, so they can be used to populate the **in-memory** H2
database. <br><br>
[Dominoes](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/Dominoes): This package was an assignment I had to complete in
college. I kept it because it was one of the more difficult to grasp concepts for me at the time. I come back to review
this often when I need to brush up on fundamentals. The code isn't perfect, but I modify it at times to accommodate to
the new Java versions.<br><br>
[HelloWorld](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/HelloWorld): This is the basic hello world application that
every programmer is introduced to, no matter the language. There's also a baby back ribs loop in here that I added just
to play with :rofl: <br><br>
[OOPConcepts](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/OOPConcepts): This package contains the applications of the
Object-Oriented Programming concepts: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.<br><br>
[Restaurant](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/Restaurant): This is a for fun package to be a functional
Restaurant (In Progress).<br><br>
[Servlets](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/Servlets): This is an example of a servlet being used to store and
return values via servlet calls.<br><br>
[TCP](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/TCP) and [UDP](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/UDP): These
packages contain the application of file sending and retrieval using both UDP and TCP protocols.<br><br>
[ToDoList](kollier-martin/tree/main/Practice/Java/src/ToDoList): This is a for fun package containing a ToDoList.

## • Scala (WIP) •

This will be used as my Scala playground

## • SQL (WIP) •

This will be used for containing SQL scripts showing how keys and manipulation work using different SQL dialects.
