# Eastern Train Company

### Project Description

Eastern Train Route is a kiosk inside a train station that allows passengers to register or login to perform different
functionalities. This allows for easier access to view and purchase tickets instead of waiting in long lines at the
train station. Passengers are allowed to ticket purchase, view available routes from multiple cities and check-in/cancel
a ticket. Administrators are able to perform and execute the same tasks as a passenger, but with more permissions, such
as creating/deleting train routes and viewing all the passengers who purchased tickets for specific routes.

### Features

- [x] As a user, I can see all available train routes from a city to a city.
- [x] As a user, I can purchase one or more train tickets.
- [x] As a user, I can check in for the train.
- [x] As a user, I can cancel my train ticket.
- [x] As an administrator, I can schedule a new train route.
- [x] As an administrator, I can cancel a train route.
- [x] As an administrator, I can see all users with tickets for a specific train route.

### Bonus Features ToDo :

- [ ] As an administrator, I can cancel a ticket for any train.
- [ ] As a conductor, I can initiate takeoff the train leaving the station. (No more new tickets or cancellations)

#### Environment Set up Steps

1. Open project in a Java IDE, preferably IntelliJ
2. To run application locally set up a 'hibernate.cfg.xml' file and place it in the 'src/main/resources' folder

```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration PUBLIC
        "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Configuration DTD 3.0//EN"
        "http://www.hibernate.org/dtd/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">

<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <!-- SQL Dialect -->
        <property name="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MariaDB103Dialect</property>

        <!-- Database Connection Settings -->
        <property name="hibernate.allow_update_outside_transaction">true</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class">org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mariadb://[DB URL]</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.username">[DB Username]</property>
        <property name="hibernate.connection.password">[DB Password]</property>

        <!-- Connection Pool Size (built-in) -->
        <property name="hibernate.connection.pool.size">1</property>

        <!-- show all generate SQL query -->
        <property name="show_sql">true</property>

        <!-- manage automatic database creation -->
        <!-- WARNING USE AN EMPTY DATABASE -->
        <!-- On first run use create. -->
        <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>

        <!-- Mention here all the model classes along with their package name -->
        <mapping class="Models.Train"/>
        <mapping class="Models.UserInfo"/>
        <mapping class="Models.User"/>
        <mapping class="Models.Schedule"/>
        <mapping class="Models.Ticket"/>
        <mapping class="Models.Station"/>
        <mapping class="Models.Role"/>
        <mapping class="Models.Trip"/>
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
